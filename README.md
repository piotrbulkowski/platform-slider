<br><b> General guidelines </b>
- use the dev branch, master should be left for show offs :)
- master branch should only contain working & tested changes
- there's no need to create feature branches if the changes are small with this project scale, <br> it's better to merge more often.
- be reasonable when commiting big files, for example in *Assets*
